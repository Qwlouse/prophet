Webtool to inspect the content of a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) that 
was populated by [Sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred).

THIS PROTOTYPE IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND IN AN ALPHA STATE.
Use at your own risk.

## Installation
You need to setup [RestHeart](http://restheart.org) on localhost such that it
