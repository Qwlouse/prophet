# Prophet
Webtool to inspect the content of a MongoDB that was populated by Sacred.

THIS PROTOTYPE IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND IN AN ALPHA STATE.
Use at your own risk.

## Installation
You need to setup [RestHeart](http://restheart.org) on localhost such that it 
has access to the MongoDB that you want to query.

Then just open index.html in a Browser and pray that it works...
